# SPEAKER RECOGNITION (SR)
## USTH 3 months Internship project (4/2024 - 7/2024)

## Description
The project aim to develope a voice recognition system which distinguish human voices

## Stutus
- Initially, I intend to build a whole system then embbedded to microcomputer like rasberry pi. Instead of making a visual product like that, i was adviced to focus on 1 task due to limitation of time. In the end, I realized this is more like a research of SR system than develope SR system.
- Since the internship is over, I have no desire to continue this project.
- This SR system does not work perfectly because of libraries and sound format differences
